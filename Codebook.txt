free_sulfur_dioxide - the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion

total_sulfur_dioxide - amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2

density - the density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content

p_H - describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4 on the scale

sulphates - a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial and preservative
